## Description: 
- The purpose of this collection of these functions and .bat files are to allow the user to quickly log the amount of time they have practiced their chosen skill. In my case, it's a 5 string banjo. 
- Once practice time (in minutes) is logged, the script will produce a graph which provides an overview of the cumulative amount of practice over time. 
- Finally, periodically run functions can check if you've recently practiced. If you haven't, Python will send you a WhatsApp message (via the Twilio service) with the aforementioned graph attached, and a predicted ETA for the completion of your goal (e.g. 2500 total hours of practice).
